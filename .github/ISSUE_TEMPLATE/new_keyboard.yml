        Tell us about the language and how Scribe can help people with it.
        Examples:
          - The number of noun genders
          - How verbs are conjugated
          - Preposition-case relationships
          - Other grammar rules that are hard

        Are there any variants in keyboard layout for this language that Scribe should keep in mind?
        For instance, French has two notable variants that are used in different countries:
          - French QWERTY keyboard used in Canada
          - French AZERTY keyboard used in France
