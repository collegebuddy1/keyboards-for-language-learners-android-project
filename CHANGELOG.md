# Changelog

See the [releases for Scribe-Android](https://github.com/scribe-org/Scribe-Android/releases) for an up to date list of versions and their release dates. Versions that are marked as released may yet to be on Google Play and other stores if it's within the submission review period.

Scribe-Android tries to follow [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/), a MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH version where increments are made of the:

-   MAJOR version when we make incompatible API changes
-   MINOR version when we add functionality in a backwards compatible manner
-   PATCH version when we make backwards compatible bug fixes

Emojis for the following are chosen based on [gitmoji](https://gitmoji.dev/).

# Scribe-Android 1.0.0
